# 🚖 Smart RideSharingSystem

A C++-based smart ride-sharing queue system that manages ride requests and drivers, optimizes routes using Dijkstra’s algorithm, and visually represents the process with an intermediate-level GUI built using Qt. Designed to demonstrate real-world DSA applications in transport tech.

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 **Ride Request Queue** – Manages incoming ride requests efficiently using queues.
- 👨‍✈️ **Driver Assignment System** – Matches drivers to riders using optimized selection.
- 🗺️ **Graph-Based Routing** – Uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest route calculations.
- 🧾 **Visual Queue Representation** – Displays live status of pending and active ride requests.
- ⚡ **Efficient Algorithms** – Queue, Linked List, and Graph data structures at core.

## 💡 Project Goals

- Apply **Data Structures & Algorithms** (DSA) in a real-world-inspired project.
- Create a **resume-worthy** C++ project with both **logic and GUI**.
- Demonstrate concepts like graph traversal, shortest paths, and dynamic queueing.
